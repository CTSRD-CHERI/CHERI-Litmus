A tool to run litmus tests on bare-metal CHERI (no OS required).

Directory layout:

  * backend: the infrastructure to run a generic litmus test

  * frontend: convert litmus files into C which when compiled with the
    backend produce a binary to be placed in CHERI's boot memory.

  * tests: sets of litmus files produced by the 'diy' tool.

  * binaries: the make script here can take a path to a set of litmus
    files and produce a set of binaries.

For example, to build the frontend (which converts litmus files to
baremetal CHERI C files), type './make.sh' in the 'frontend'
directory.  Then to generate a pile of baremetal CHERI binares, type
'./make.sh ../tests/mips/general' in the 'binaries' directory.
