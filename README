Variant of the "Litmus" tool to test memory consistency, but designed
to work on bare-metal (no OS).  Currently, we only target CHERI but
porting it to other architectures should be quite doable.

Directory layout:

  * backend: the infrastructure to run a generic litmus test

  * frontend: convert litmus files into C which when compiled with the
    backend produce a binary to be placed in CHERI's boot memory.

  * tests: a set of tests (for dual-core and quad-core) produced by
    the 'diy' tool.  These are the default PPC tests, converted to
    MIPS.

  * binaries: the make script here can take a path to a set of litmus
    files and produce a set of binaries.
